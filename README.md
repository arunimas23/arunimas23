## Hello there, I’m Arunima 🌻


I’m a product designer currently pursuing engineering at **IIT (BHU) Varanasi**. I’m driven by curiosity about how people interact with products and how small, thoughtful decisions shape meaningful experiences.
For me, design is about asking the right questions, finding clarity, and building things that truly matter.

## What I’ve done?
Over the past **~3 years**, I’ve built experience through **internships, competitions, and passion projects**, often alongside my time at IIT. I’ve worked across **healthcare, e-commerce, and consumer products**, including designing **0 → 1 AI features for JioHealthHub at Reliance Jio** and leading **end-to-end product and branding work** for early-stage teams. I enjoy spotting everyday problems and turning them into thoughtful design solutions.

## Why I chose design?
I’ve always been a **curious, observant person**. Growing up, I noticed small details like spelling mistakes on menus and posters, and how they subtly changed how a place felt. Over time, I realized these weren’t just mistakes, but signs of overlooked effort, and that thoughtful design can help prevent them.

## But.. why not just graphic design?
I started out with **graphic design and branding**, but I found myself more interested in _why_ things worked the way they did, not just how they looked. Reading **Don’t Make Me Think** helped connect the dots, and product design gave me the space to think beyond visuals, understand users and systems, and fix problems at their root.

## Tools & how I think about them
I use **Figma** for most of my work, along with **Illustrator, Photoshop, and Framer**.
Tools evolve constantly, so I stay curious and currently explore **AI-powered tools** with real impact on design workflows, like **Cursor** and **Lovable**.
